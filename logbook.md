## Work log

### 2026-06-11

**Worked on:**
Initial project setup, Git repository structure, signature scripts and GitHub remote setup.

**What I did:**
Created the project folder, initialized Git, created the folder structure, started the main Markdown logbook, created signature scripts for Linux and Windows Server, and pushed the repository to GitHub.

**Problems and solutions:**
I first had trouble finding the correct project folder because Windows showed both OneDrive Documents and the local Documents folder. I solved this by using the full path to the project folder: `C:\Users\rband\Documents\Bjorklunda-Admin-Lab`.

**Decisions I made:**
I chose to use the repository name `Bjorklunda-Admin-Lab` because this is a voluntary portfolio project and not a formal school submission.

**Sources I used:**

* School assignment PDF: Case IT-tekniker på Björklunda kommun

## Part 1 — Preparation and repository setup

I created the project folder `Bjorklunda-Admin-Lab` on my Windows computer and initialized it as a Git repository.

The folder structure was created with:

* `screenshots/` for screenshots and evidence
* `scripts/` for Bash and PowerShell scripts
* `data/` for CSV and input files
* `results/` for output and result files

The purpose of this structure is to keep documentation, scripts, screenshots and result files separated and easy to find.

I created the first screenshot showing the initial Git commit history.

I created two signature scripts:

* `scripts/signature.sh` for Linux servers
* `scripts/signature.ps1` for Windows Server

The purpose of the signature scripts is to show name, email, timestamp, hostname and IP address in screenshots, so each screenshot can be connected to the correct server and moment.

The Linux script is used on RHEL servers to show my name, email, timestamp, hostname and IP address before taking screenshots.

The Windows PowerShell script is used on Windows Server for the same purpose.

The second commit was created with the message:

`Complete part 1: setup and signature scripts`

The Git history showed two commits, which confirmed that the initial repository setup and Part 1 signature scripts were saved in version control.

The local Git repository was connected to GitHub using a remote called `origin`.

The branch was renamed to `main`, and the project was pushed to GitHub.

Commands used:

```powershell
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/TheBoochy/Bjorklunda-Admin-Lab.git
git push -u origin main
```

The command `git branch -M main` renamed the local branch to `main`.

The command `git remote add origin ...` connected the local repository to the GitHub repository.

The command `git push -u origin main` uploaded the local commits to GitHub and connected the local `main` branch to the GitHub `main` branch.

After pushing, `git status` showed that the working tree was clean and up to date with `origin/main`.
